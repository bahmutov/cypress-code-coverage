Code coverage for TypeScript code. See [nyc TS support](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#typescript-projects) docs too.

Code is instrumented on the fly using [.babelrc](.babelrc) and Parcel to run it.

## Use

- start the server and Cypress with `npm run dev`
- run the Cypress tests
- look at the generated reports in folder `coverage`
